Execution:
To work with the project, we made a makefile to make things easier to compile and run.
The makefile has the following commands:
- make compile : just compiles the source code into the bin folder
- make fichier1 : compiles the source code and runs the program with the file1.md as input
- make fichier2 : compiles the source code and runs the program with the file2.md as input
- make fichier3 : compiles the source code and runs the program with the file3.md as input
- make clean : removes the bin folder

Known bugs:
- The song is looped, we don't know how much times, but each time the notes are 2 notes higher than the previous loop
